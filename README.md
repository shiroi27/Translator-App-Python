# 💬 Translator + Text-to-Speech App 🎙️  
**Day 5 of #100DaysOfCode**

---

A **multi-language Translator + Text-to-Speech** app made using **Python**, **Tkinter**, **gTTS**, and **Deep Translator**.  
I built this from scratch with a colorful, clean GUI and added smooth functionality for both translating and speaking text!  
✨ Looks friendly, fun, and functional!

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🌐 Translate text into 6 languages: Hindi, French, Spanish, German, Korean, Japanese  
- 🎤 Convert translated text to speech (Text-to-Speech)  
- 💬 Easy-to-use text boxes for input/output  
- 🎯 Simple language selector  
- 🎨 Custom-designed layout using `tkinter` with color themes

---

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3.11** installed.
2. Install required libraries :

```bash
pip install tkinter
pip install gTTS
pip install deep-translator
```

3. Run the program:
```bash
python translator2.py
```

✅ That’s it! The app will launch in a window and you’re ready to translate and speak.
